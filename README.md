## How to build and run

1. [Install the Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
2. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:kawogi/3du.git`
3. Change into the project directory: `cd 3du`
4. Build and run the code: `cargo run`

This will open a new window, showing a 3D-Cube, while the terminal prints some logs with the string "Hello, World!" in between, which is the result of the executed python code.

Exit with `ESC` or just close the window.
