# Gam3du

A game engine written for educational purposes. The main goals are learning/teaching software development, ease of use and having fun!

> In the beginning, there was `0x00`.

This project is currently in its proof-of-concept phase, where we try to evaluate whether the undertaking is feasible as a whole. Next goal is an MVP (minimum viable product) that can be used to teach simple programming tasks in the Python programming language.

## How to build and run

1. [Install the Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
2. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:gam3du/gam3du.git`
3. Change into the project directory: `cd gam3du`
4. Build and run the code: `cargo run --bin=python_robot`

This will open a new window, showing a plane where a Python-controlled robot is moving across the grid.

Exit with `ESC` or just close the window.
